#Mini Custom Chatbot

This project is a custom chatbot implementation using LangChain and OpenAI GPT models. It integrates vector storage and advanced retrieval mechanisms, focusing on personalized interactions based on input data.

**Features**
Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

Combines a retrieval system with OpenAI GPT to enhance responses by using contextual data.
Implements an effective vector store for content-based searches.
Vector Database Integration:

Uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to store and query embeddings.
Demonstrates a functional database for vectorized document chunks.
Dynamic Query Processing:

Implements embeddings with OpenAI API.
Provides utilities to visualize vector store content.
