R. Martin. He began writing the first volume, A Game of Thrones, in 1991, publishing it in 1996. Martin originally envisioned the series as a trilogy but has released five out of a planned seven volumes. The fifth and most recent entry in the series, A Dance with Dragons, was published in 2011.

What little supernatural power exists is confined to the margins of the known world. Moral ambiguity pervades the books and their stories continually raise questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence.

Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel, the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty, establishing military supremacy through their control of dragons. The Targaryens ruled for three hundred years, continuing beyond the extinction of the dragons. Their dynasty eventually ended with a rebellion led by Lord Robert Baratheon, in which Aerys

Martin was already a successful fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his A Song of Ice and Fire book series.[24] Martin had published his first short story in 1971 and his first novel in 1977.[25] By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction.[26] Although his early books were well-received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer

He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made[26] and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes.[27] This pushed Martin

R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.[28]

After three chapters, he had a vivid idea of a boy seeing a man's beheading and finding direwolves in the snow, which would eventually become the first non-prologue chapter of A Game of Thrones.[29] Putting Avalon aside, Martin finished this chapter in a few days and grew certain that it was part of a longer story. After a few more chapters, Martin perceived his new

I was...at work on a different novel, and suddenly I saw that scene. It didn't belong in the novel I was writing, but it came to me so vividly that I had to sit down and write it, and by the time I did, it led to a second chapter, and the second chapter was the Catelyn chapter where Ned has just come back.""

When Martin had still not reached the novel's end at 1,400 manuscript pages, he felt that the series needed to be four and eventually six books long,[27][32] which he imagined as two linked trilogies of one long story.[33] Martin chose A Song of Ice and Fire as the overall series title:

Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.[44]

On one hand, Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years.[43] After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book,

Printing the book in ""microtype on onion skin paper and giving each reader a magnifying glass"" was also not an option for him.[36] On the other hand, Martin rejected the publishers' idea of splitting the narrative chronologically into A Feast for Crows,"

The war emerged between the children of the late Viserys I Targaryen: his eldest daughter, Rhaenyra, and his eldest son, Aegon II, over who should succeed their father on the Iron Throne. It is the first full-scale civil war to ever take place in the Seven Kingdoms.
